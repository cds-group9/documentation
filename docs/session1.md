## Setup Study Environment

- Make sure Chrome is installed on your computer
- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session1](https://participate.lookback.io/YuaArP?live) and wait for the research team to join

## Goal for Session 1

In this session, groups will first explore the problem space, understand the dataset, build and test the hypothesis on what features might strongly/weakly relate to the ‘SalePrice’. 

- Groups may look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem
- Groups may apply descriptive statistics and data visualizations to understand the dependent variable - ‘Sale Price’ (e.g., deviating from the normal distribution, peakedness)
- Groups may apply descriptive statistics and data visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps, histograms) to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate - some variables might be outliers

## After Session 1

- Please fill this [diary](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_74LHSKuYrkvPP9z) (roughly 5 mins to finish) for we to collect feedbacks from your collaboration experience.
