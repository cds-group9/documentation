## Setup Study Environment

- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session3](https://participate.lookback.io/jiDkCd?live) and wait for the research team to join

## Goal for Session 3

In this session, groups will apply the basic regression model to predict the house price. For reference, your regression algorithm should at least beat the baseline score (<=0.4).

- Groups may use the sci-kit learn library to apply a basic linear regression model
- Groups may use cross-validation to examine the performance of the model.

## After Session 3

- Please fill this [diary](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ezFvfDsWWU3mXZ3) (roughly 5 mins to finish) for we to collect feedbacks from your collaboration experience.
