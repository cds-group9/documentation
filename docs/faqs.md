## What if the notebook is not working?

Since Experimentor is still a research prototype, it might run into issues. If the Python code in your notebook is not working, please try to restart the kernel. If it doesn't work out, or you experience other issues, please contact April via Slack or email.

## What if I have come across similar data science challenges before?

The goal of this study is to understand how data scientists collaborate using Jupyter Notebook and improve the tools for better collaboration. So please try best to put yourself in the shoes of collaborating with colleagues on a data science challenge. If you have come across similar data science challenges before, please try not to look at your previous solutions, or search on Google for other people's solutions.
