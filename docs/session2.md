## Setup Study Environment

- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session2](https://participate.lookback.io/XeFDg3?live) and wait for the research team to join

## Goal for Session 2

In this session, groups will clean the dataset based on findings in the previous session.

- Groups may develop their own strategies to handle missing data (N/As). For example, delete a record if it has too many missing attributes; use min/max/mean/median/mod to fill numerical missing attributes
- Groups may need to normalize numerical data
- Groups may remove non-related attributes and outlier records
- Groups may encode discrete attributes to numerical values, for example, using index

## After Session 2
- Please fill this [diary](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_73Tuf6E0mDItGrb) (roughly 5 mins to finish) for we to collect feedbacks from your collaboration experience.
