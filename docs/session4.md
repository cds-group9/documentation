## Setup Study Environment

- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session4](https://participate.lookback.io/TPQ6eT?live) and wait for the research team to join

## Goal for Session 4

In this session, groups should try multiple models or refine the dataset to improve the precision result.

- Groups may refine the dataset and apply the same model to see if the result improves
- Groups may apply different regression models or even deep learning models

## After Session 4

- Please fill this [diary](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gZFzbpXFJgtVDD) (roughly 5 mins to finish) for we to collect feedbacks from your collaboration experience.
